/**
 * Route-interception "server" for e2e specs.
 *
 * Business purpose: we need a deterministic host origin that loads the
 * built IIFE bundle without standing up a real dev server. Playwright's
 * `page.route()` lets us fulfill every request for a synthetic origin
 * from disk, so specs are hermetic (no network, no user-app dependency)
 * and reproduce on any contributor's machine regardless of which ports
 * are free.
 *
 * Resolution rules are intentionally strict — the only URLs we answer
 * are the fixture HTML and the bundle. Any other hit is a bug (usually
 * a stray <link>/<img> in a fixture or the bundle reaching for the
 * Vite HMR endpoint) and routes `continue()` so it fails noisily.
